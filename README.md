# Memory Box

Show that special someone that you are thinking about them with an interactive, handheld, battery-powered device.

The first menu option is the "Vault" where images and their associated dates and times are displayed. The second menu option is the "Bucket List" which contains places or things that you would like to add to the memory box.

Right now updating the memory box will be a manual process. But if time allows I want the images to be automatically pulled from the card and arranged by date.

### Materials

* x1 Arduino Nano
* x1 ST7735 TFT LCD
* x3 Buttons
* x3 10k ohm resistors
* x1 9V battery

### Wiring

Coming soon...

### Libraries

Uses the Adafruit_GFX, Adafruit_ST7735, and Adafruit SD libraries. I could probably just list the dependencies in PlatformIO and have them download automatically but I'm too lazy right now.
