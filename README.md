# Letter

Show that special someone that you are thinking about them with an interactive, handheld, battery-powered device.

The lucky recipient will be able to navigate the letter using a cute platforming character that can move left and right. He can jump and hit little boxes that pop up with encouraging messages of your choice. Nifty!

### Wiring

### Libraries

Uses the Adafruit_GFX and Adafruit_PCD8544 libraries. I could probably just list the dependencies in PlatformIO and have them download automatically but I'm too lazy right now.
